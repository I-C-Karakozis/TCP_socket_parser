# TCP_socket_parser
Simple script that allows user to listen and parse content via a TCP socket connection

This is a great script to get yourself off the ground at trading competitions. It allows your team to quickly connect to the virtual market and focus on developing trading strategies rather than worrying about how to parse incoming information and place orders.
